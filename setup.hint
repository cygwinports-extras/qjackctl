ldesc: "QjackCtl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound 
server daemon.  It provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK 
daemon parameters, which are properly saved between sessions, and a way 
control of the status of the audio server daemon. With time, this 
primordial interface has become richer by including a enhanced patchbay 
and connection control features."
